# Second Son fidelity and high-refresh evidence

This is the public, hash-bound receipt for issue #137 and draft PR #139. The captures used the
same owned CUSA00223 v1.00 save, an isolated copy of the shadPS4 user profile, a warm 636-pipeline
cache, and optimized Linux binary SHA-256
`0d0741b6d2bf337db576e762f8008494cbff4bf0f0b5099bf565e4b87aa9190c` at commit
`fd44306c2f9fd19dd167a363966f002ac2dde4ff`.

## RR — Really Readable rundown

### Proven

- The game calls `sceVideoOutSetBufferAttribute` and `RegisterBuffers` with 1920×1080 buffers.
  Requests for 1280×720 and 1920×1080 guest-display metadata both produced 1920×1080 pre-scale
  game screenshots. The new shadPS4 internal-screen setting does not change this title's render
  buffer allocation.
- Gamescope and Vulkan created the exact requested 2560×1440, 3840×2160, and 7680×4320
  swapchains. Post-scale screenshots had those exact dimensions.
- The 120 Hz profiles measured approximately 120 host vblanks/s. During the loaded unattended
  crash-site scene, unique guest flips settled near 18–20/s at both 60 and 120 Hz. A 120 Hz
  presentation is therefore not 120 FPS gameplay.
- Warm runs preloaded 636 pipelines. The FSR-on 1440p, 4K, and 8K captures compiled zero graphics,
  compute, or guest shaders.
- The bounded 8K/60 FSR+RCAS run peaked at 10.38 GB VRAM, 46% GPU load, and 163 W. The bounded
  8K/120 run peaked at 10.51 GB VRAM, 50% GPU load, and 248 W. Both left the live Steam profile
  byte-for-byte unchanged.
- The issue #140 IPC-stop launcher candidate completed a 35-second post-load Gamescope run with
  both screenshot modes, status 0, a normal play-time/cache close, no Vulkan assertion, no retained
  processes, and an unchanged live profile.
- A matched-camera 8K/60 control with FSR and RCAS disabled had consistently lower grayscale edge
  energy after resizing to the host's 2560×1440 display. Across four static-heavy crops, the
  FSR+RCAS image measured about 1.3–2.1% higher. This is a directional sharpness measure, not a
  perceptual-quality score.
- Issue #141 traced a filtered-logging hot path to 255,269 and 256,727 Linux
  `pthread_getname_np` calls in two 27-second control runs. Gating `LOG_GENERIC` before argument
  evaluation reduced both patched runs to 1,320 calls, a 99.48% reduction against the control
  mean. All four runs exited status 0 and left the live Steam profile unchanged.
- In the same A/B/A/B sequence, MangoHud's final-ten-second mean rose from 21.67 and 21.12 FPS in
  the controls to 22.72 and 22.37 FPS in the candidates. The two-run averages are 21.395 versus
  22.545 FPS, a replicated 5.38% improvement. Direct guest-flip cadence in the first A/B/A legs
  changed from 20.774 / 22.289 / 20.996 FPS, or 6.72% above the mean of the two controls.
- The exact-commit replication used commit `1f169375a180be331337fdee31d0e9048dd040b5`
  and binary SHA-256 `b2daafb47298d930c75cb72100e883d4af0ad4853cdbfba65cda36a13c5f9407`.
  The focused logging regression test, all 78 settings tests, and all 134 Deck-tool tests passed
  locally on Linux.

| Profile | Actual game buffer | Actual swapchain | Host refresh | Loaded guest flips | Peak VRAM | Peak GPU |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 1440p/60, FSR+RCAS | 1920×1080 | 2560×1440 | 60 Hz | about 20 FPS | 6.88 GB | 64% |
| 4K/60, FSR+RCAS | 1920×1080 | 3840×2160 | 60 Hz | about 19–20 FPS | 7.55 GB | 62% |
| 4K/120, FSR+RCAS | 1920×1080 | 3840×2160 | 120 Hz | about 19–20 FPS | 7.58 GB | 40% |
| 8K/60, FSR+RCAS | 1920×1080 | 7680×4320 | 60 Hz | about 18–19 FPS | 10.38 GB | 46% |
| 8K/120, FSR+RCAS | 1920×1080 | 7680×4320 | 120 Hz | about 18–19 FPS | 10.51 GB | 50% |

### Inference

- Output scaling is not the cause of the loaded scene's low guest rate: 8K/120 leaves substantial
  GPU and VRAM headroom while unique game flips remain near 20/s.
- Filtered log argument evaluation was a real CPU-side contributor in the serialized GPU command
  lane. Removing it produced a repeatable gain, but the remaining roughly 21–23 FPS phase proves
  that it was not the dominant bottleneck.
- FSR EASU with RCAS attenuation 0 is the strongest current clarity candidate for this machine.
  It improves edge retention, but it cannot restore texture or geometry detail that is absent from
  the fixed 1920×1080 source.
- Real native 1440p/4K rendering requires a guarded game patch or hook at the title's allocation
  site. Relabeling shadPS4's guest-display metadata is insufficient.

### Unknown / next gate

- Interactive traversal, combat, camera motion, cutscenes, controller/touch/QTE timing, audio,
  game speed, and long-session stability still need to be tested on the exact candidate.
- The remaining loaded-scene limit still needs finer attribution inside GPU command processing,
  especially resource binding, buffer/texture-cache lookup and synchronization, page protection,
  and pipeline-key lookup. The high-output runs rule out simple RTX 3090 saturation, and the
  post-budget readback timing no longer supports precise-readback finish as the dominant cost.
- Whether the guarded v1.00 motion-blur exposure patch improves moving-image clarity without
  artifacts remains unproven.
- A normal user-requested in-game exit remains to be included in the interactive acceptance run.
  The separate issue #140 timeout-order defect is fixed and locally proven in this branch, but is
  not integrated until PR #139 lands.

No 4K, 8K, or 120 Hz profile is promoted to the normal Steam launch by this receipt.

## Submission-side stream-bound recorder — 2026-08-24, 8:51 PM CDT

### RR — Really Readable rundown

#### Proven

- Issue #153 moves unchanged stream-bound detection off every high-frequency `StreamBuffer`
  commit and performs it once when the scheduler assigns the exact Vulkan submission tick. Commit
  `e7c03042cd426ffed7d3e213226352031f69e462` keeps the coherent commit path inline, preserves the
  non-coherent flush path, and resets the recorder across ring wrap.
- The focused stream-watch suite passes 5/5, the atomic-reader-lock suite passes 5/5, the complete
  Deck suite passes 143/143, whitespace checks pass, and the optimized Linux executable links with
  `-O2 -g -DNDEBUG`.
- The exact committed executable has SHA-256
  `68d12a41294bd56caaf0117c4583f4cae821a58a7303221d1adf3d6508c53f7c` and embeds
  `v.0.18.0-237-ge7c03042`. Its isolated smoke preloaded 633 pipelines, compiled/regenerated
  nothing, exited 0, and left the live title profile unchanged.
- The warm baseline profile captured 1,362 GpuComm samples, with 219 (16.08%) in the old
  `StreamBuffer::Commit` leaf and 218 at its per-commit bound accumulation. The candidate captured
  1,373 GpuComm samples with zero in the old Commit, non-coherent slow path, or recorder leaf. Both
  profiles lost zero samples.
- Two warm controls averaged 29.07 post-load guest FPS and two candidates averaged 29.57 (+1.72%).
  Post-load median remained about 30 FPS and p95 remained about 50 ms.

#### Inference

- The measured hot instruction is conclusively absent, and the small FPS direction is consistent
  with moving bookkeeping to submission. Instrumentation outliers prevent a mean-frame-time or
  material whole-game throughput claim.

#### Unknown / next gate

- Every runtime measurement above covers only the intro/crash-site workload before the city. City
  traversal, crowds, combat, smoke/particles, rapid camera movement, cutscenes, and longer play may
  expose different CPU or GPU limits.
- NVIDIA driver work, `memcpy`, buffer binding, and a memory-tracker mutex are the next sampled
  candidates. The mutex needs a repeated exact-revision profile before another code change.
- The public aggregate receipt has SHA-256
  `a93bc3cca819ab83cedaa2172bfc9493b3a4fe22599453cb7d831549f75843f1`.

## Pending stream-bound flag — 2026-08-24, 7:53 PM CDT

### RR — Really Readable rundown

#### Proven

- Issue #151 follows the submit-boundary change by removing the duplicate 64-bit pending-bound
  store from every stream-buffer commit. Commit
  `fbc64ee1a7a0aaf76aa3d300a6739ed7e4f71a9a` keeps the StreamBuffer offset authoritative and
  stores only whether unsubmitted data exists.
- Candidate assembly retains the authoritative offset store, tests the pending flag, and writes
  the flag only for the first commit before a submission. The duplicate upper-bound store is gone.
- The focused lock/watch suite passes 9/9, the complete Deck suite passes 142/142, and the optimized
  Linux executable links. The candidate smoke/profile exits 0, preloads 696 pipelines, compiles
  and regenerates nothing, and leaves the live title profile unchanged.
- A warmed candidate-control-candidate-control bracket averaged 29.695 versus 29.205 post-load FPS
  (+1.68%) and 36.250 versus 36.840 ms mean frame time (-1.60%). Final-ten-second averages were
  28.010 versus 27.890 FPS (+0.43%) and 36.660 versus 36.845 ms (-0.50%); p95 remained effectively
  neutral near 50 ms.
- The candidate executable has SHA-256
  `a6b8796cfafe00307218763b0f12616cbd60fa9cf8e896eee8de514113047f95`. The public aggregate
  receipt has SHA-256 `348f3eca7024fe6e36abfd531ae1b251bfbefc5b29b46f1ae3e477f7a3a26570`.

#### Inference

- Both alternating candidate legs beat their adjacent controls after load, and the redundant
  stores are absent. The small movement is consistent with reduced hot-path bookkeeping but does
  not support a material throughput claim.

#### Unknown / next gate

- Hardware-cycle sampling attributes 374/2,518 GpuComm samples (14.85%) to the shorter pending-flag
  branch versus 345/2,511 (13.74%) at the old pending-bound store. No profiler-residency gain is
  claimed.
- Interactive traversal, combat, controller/touch/QTE behavior, audio, game speed, and long-session
  stability remain branch-level acceptance gates. Resource binding and driver work remain the next
  performance-attribution candidates.

## Shared-memory stream reservation — 2026-08-24, 8:10 PM CDT

### RR — Really Readable rundown

#### Proven

- Issue #152 found that the compute SharedMemory descriptor path mapped and zeroed a Stream utility
  buffer region, then bound it without calling `Commit()`. `Map()` does not advance the ring;
  `Commit()` advances it, flushes non-coherent writes, and marks the submitted bound.
- Commit `e54a96d986d885d0c55ca7ed61290c5123980946` enforces `Map → zero → Commit → bind`.
  Current upstream `main` at `7fb1a530c15415097836521fec6f3483e27c81ae` contains the same
  original omission.
- The focused source-contract test passes 1/1, the complete Deck suite passes 143/143, Python byte
  compilation/Ruff/whitespace pass, the changed Vulkan translation unit compiles, and the complete
  optimized Linux executable links with `-O2 -g -DNDEBUG`.
- The exact clean binary has SHA-256
  `deeaab643a1efc28f44acc03f0602fde7a83f368e86ce2831e0a5075ad47d3aa` and embeds
  `v.0.18.0-235-ge54a96d9`.
- Its isolated Second Son smoke preloaded 615 pipelines with zero graphics/compute/guest shader
  compiles, zero cache regenerations, exit 0, and an unchanged live title profile.

#### Inference

- Missing `Commit()` can alias lowered shared-memory storage with a later reservation before
  submission and can omit the required flush on a non-coherent host. Restoring the StreamBuffer
  contract is a correctness fix even when a particular title scene does not enter the fallback.

#### Unknown / next gate

- A temporary, uncommitted first-hit probe recorded zero fallback binds in the 25-second loaded
  Second Son scene. It was removed, and rebuilding restored the exact clean binary hash above.
- Other scenes may still exercise the fallback. No Second Son visual, correctness, or performance
  gain is claimed from this run; interactive traversal/combat/cutscene coverage remains necessary.
- The public receipt has SHA-256
  `b8ff529243a228f23df92842dbfcb8d5f781e03d2509c6aabcc622ec133949cc`.

## Persistent host tiling shader cache — 2026-08-24, 5:31 PM CDT

### RR — Really Readable rundown

#### Proven

- Issue #147 identified ten host tiling/detiling shaders that glslang rebuilt on every launch even
  when all 676 guest pipelines were already warm. Commit
  `a8f6e90dc3cb8b706a4368be818764b564ed0d32` stores their SPIR-V in the existing compatible
  per-title shader database.
- The key covers the complete GLSL source, Vulkan stage, and ordered define list. Cached data must
  contain a valid SPIR-V 1.3 header; a missing or invalid entry falls back to glslang and is replaced.
- The focused key/header suite passed 2/2 and the complete `deck_tools` suite passed 142/142. The
  optimized portable Linux build used `-O2 -g -DNDEBUG -march=x86-64-v3` and linked successfully.
- The exact candidate executable has SHA-256
  `b2f3f71003aa23c416a21063d13326a6ce030ad210012e2769fcadc613c787ac`.
- The cold isolated run `20260824-172613-247039` preloaded 676 guest pipelines, compiled zero guest
  graphics/compute pipelines, regenerated no cache, compiled exactly ten host detilers, wrote ten
  host SPIR-V files, exited 0, and left the live Steam profile unchanged.
- The matching warm run `20260824-172745-281523` preloaded the same 676 guest pipelines, loaded all
  ten host detilers, compiled none of them, regenerated no cache, exited 0, and left the live Steam
  profile unchanged. Its performance-summary receipt has SHA-256
  `423205cf8e68e07343a53d7bd21a5c7c684bb59c3f83e4f3c3c6f48ee93a6e74`.
- A final 25-second clean-commit smoke, `20260824-173030-344213`, again loaded all ten entries with
  zero host compiles and exited 0. Its pipeline summary has SHA-256
  `730ddd5fefc78dab9865e00a8136e28d59cf3774091236e3c6e6b4a4d843bc25`.

#### Inference

- This removes deterministic glslang work and its first-use stalls after the first successful run.
  It is a launch/first-use improvement, not a sustained-FPS optimization.
- Cold and warm post-load means were 27.36 and 27.15 FPS. That small difference is normal run
  variation and does not support a steady-state speed claim.

#### Unknown / next gate

- Interactive traversal, combat, touch/QTE behavior, audio, game speed, and long-session stability
  remain the acceptance gates for the complete branch.
- The USB controller is detected, but this controller still exposes no usable gyro or accelerometer
  through SDL. Motion-dependent scenes therefore remain a separate input lane.
- Texture replacement tools exist, but a meaningful replacement texture has not yet been visually
  activated and accepted in gameplay.
